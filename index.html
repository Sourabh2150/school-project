        <h2>welcome to indirapuram pubic school</h2>
        <p>The School began on April 16, 2003 as Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Public School in association with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai. Forging ahead Indirapuram Public School set course on its own on 1st April 2007. The School focuses on inculcating the best in its students by providing an environment in which the students discover and realize their potential with a view to empowering them to be responsible citizens and leaders of the nation and the global society of tomorrow. We encourage a value system that is essentially Indian yet catering to the global perspective, being a CBSE school, sharing online facilities that enable us to be a pool school, where ideas are shared and welcomed.</p>
        <p>We are proud to have on our faculty a team of capable and experienced teachers. An extremely competent Principal having experience of working in the top schools in India and beyond who provides innovating ideas to the education group. A capable and supportive managing body has provided all essential support to ensure that the school functions as an example of excellence among top schools in Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi.
